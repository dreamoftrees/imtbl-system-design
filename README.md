## The Gods Unchained Workshop

The Workshop, also know as The Deck Builder; is a place where players can build decks they would like to play with.
The top row of cards are the Gods Unchained library of cards. This library can be filtered by attributes and their attribute values.

The second row of cards are the players deck. Each players deck holds a maximum of 30 cards.
Players have the ability to load and save existing decks, and create new decks.

How would you approach the architecture & implementation of this feature?
Some key aspects to consider:
- API requirements; What endpoints would be needed?
- Browser performance; How to approach the library supporting 100,000 cards?
- Responsive design; What techniques would be required?
